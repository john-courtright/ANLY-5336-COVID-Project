This repository contains files related to TXST's Intro to Analytics (Graduate Level; ANLY 5336) group project. The topic of this project is COVID-19 in Travis County, TX. 

All COVID-19 data comes from The New York Time's COVID data repository. This project uses figures on weekly cases, deaths, and mask use.

The project is split into 3 steps:
1) Parsing the original data sets to find a county that has a consistent 3-year span of reporting
2) Conducting predctive analysis (multivariate regression and time-series forecasting)
3) Conducting prescriptive analysis (deciding if there is sufficient risk to warrant construction of a dedicated COVID facility in the county)
